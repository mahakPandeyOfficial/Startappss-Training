## What is Git?

**Git** is a **distributed version control system** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously without interfering with each other.

### Key Features of Git

- **Version Control**: Tracks changes in source code over time.
- **Distributed System**: Each developer has a full copy of the project history.
- **Branching and Merging**: Allows for easy experimentation and collaboration.
- **Efficient and Fast**: Designed for performance.

### Basic Git Terms

- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage space for your project and its version history.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the code.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development.
- **Merge**: Combining different branches together.

**GitHub** is a **cloud-based hosting platform** that allows developers to store, manage, and share Git repositories. It adds a web-based interface and collaboration tools to Git.

### Key Features of GitHub

- **Remote Repositories**: Store your Git repositories online.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Pull requests, code reviews, and issues.
- **Integration**: Works with CI/CD tools, project management apps, etc.
