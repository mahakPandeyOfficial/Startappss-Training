###  What is EJS?

      EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It is commonly used in Node.js applications to dynamically render content on the server side before sending it to the client.

      EJS lets you embed JavaScript code within HTML.

      EJS allows you to:

            - Embed JavaScript code inside HTML using <% %>

            - Output dynamic data using <%= %>

            - Include partial templates (reusable components)

            - Loop through arrays or use conditional logic inside your HTML

### Simple Syntax: 

        ```
            <!-- Simple EJS template example -->
            <h1>Hello, <%= username %>!</h1>

            <% if (isLoggedIn) { %>
            <p>Welcome back!</p>
            <% } else { %>
            <p>Please log in.</p>
            <% } %>

            <ul>
            <% users.forEach(function(user) { %>
                <li><%= user.name %></li>
            <% }); %>
            </ul>
        ```                

### How to Use it?

     1. Install Packages dependency: cmd = npm i ejs 

     2. Set EJS as the view engine in Express: 
           => app.set('view engine', 'ejs');      // This has to be set as it used to set view engine.
           => app.set('views', 'views');          //This can be neglected as it is default same as views
    
     3. Create a file views/index.ejs and use EJS syntax there.

###  When to Use EJS:
         -   You want server-side rendering with Express.js.

         -   You prefer logic in templates with basic JavaScript.

         -   You are building simple or medium-complexity apps that don't need a full frontend framework like React.
