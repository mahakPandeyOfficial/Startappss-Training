#### Introduction to Node JS:

   Node.js ek JavaScript runtime environment hai jiske through aap JavaScript ko browser ke bahar (server side) pe run kar sakte ho.

    ➡️ Ye Chrome ke V8 engine par based hai (jo browser me JavaScript chalata hai).

    ➡️ Mainly use hota hai fast, scalable aur real-time applications banane ke liye (jaise chat apps, APIs, etc.).
    Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, Google Chrome's core, outside the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant. A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

    Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

    What are the FEATURES that are added into V8 for making a  NODE.JS:

    -> libuv : A C++ library that adds asynchronous I/O, event loop, and thread pool to support non-blocking operations (like file system, network, DNS, etc.).

    -> Node Api's : Built-in modules like fs, http, path, os, crypto, etc., were added so JavaScript could interact with files, servers, and system resources.

    -> C++ Binding : 	Native C++ bindings are used to connect V8 to system-level features via libraries like libuv. This allows Node to perform tasks that browsers cannot.

    -> Module Systems ( Common JS) : Node.js added require() and module.exports to support modular JavaScript code outside the browser.

    -> EventEmmiter: Node includes an EventEmitter class to create and handle events — useful for real-time and I/O-based systems.

    -> Global Object: 	Things like __dirname, process, global, and Buffer were introduced to provide environment-specific information.

    -> REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) : Node.js includes a command line REPL tool to experiment with Javascript directly in the terminal.
    
    -> npm Ecosystem: Node added a support for a package manager ( npm ) that allows developer to install and manages external librariers easly with just one simple command.

    ****NOTE**** 
        ** V8 sirf JavaScript run karta hai, browser ke liye.

        ** Node.js ne V8 ke upar system-level features add kiye — jaise file system, HTTP server, etc.

        ** Ye kaam libuv, Node’s C++ bindings, aur custom APIs ke through hota hai.

        ** Is wajah se hum JavaScript se backend server bhi bana sakte hain.
