1. Three Core Concepts of Redux : 

 # STORE

   -the store holds the state of your Application
 
 # ACTION 
   
  -an action that decribes the changes in the state of the Application

 # REDUCER

  -A Reducer which carries out the state transition depending on the action.

2. Three Principles of Redux :

  # First Principle = "The State of your whole Application is stored in an object tree within a single store".
     // Lets assume we are tracking the no. of cakes on the shelf
     {
        numberOfCakes: 10
     } 

   # Second Principle = "The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object dsecribing what happened"  
     // Let the ShopKeeper know about your action of BUY_CAKE
     {
        type: 'BUY_CAKE',
     }

   # Third Principle = "To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers"

     - Reducer - (previousState, action) => newState

     //Reducer is the ShopKeeper
     const reducer = (state, action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
            case 'BUY_CAKE': return {
                numberOfCakes: state.numberOfCakes - 1;
            }

        }
     } 

3. ACTIONS :
  
  - The Only way that your application can interact with the store is Action.
  - Actions are payloads that send data from your application to the store.
  - Actions are plain JavaScript objects. They don't mutate the state. They simply describe changes to
  - Carry Some information from your app to the redux store.
